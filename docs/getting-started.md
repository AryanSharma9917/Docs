# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

- Go (>= 1.16)

## Installation

To install the Codewise-CLI, use the command `go install github.com/AryanSharma9917/Codewise-CLI@latest`.

Go will automatically install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which should be in your `$PATH`.

Once installed, you can use the `codewise-cli` CLI command. To confirm installation, type `codewise-cli` at the command line.

**Note:** If you are getting an error like `command not found: codewise-cli`, then you need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable. For that, you can refer to [this](https://gist.github.com/AryanSharma9917/a93356bb49a7269826976d7f8d89f11a).

## Updating Codewise-CLI

To update Codewise-CLI, use the command `go install github.com/AryanSharma9917/Codewise-CLI@latest`. It will automatically update Codewise-CLI to the latest version.
